//Assume an electric vehicle must go from source city s to destination city d. You can locate many service centers
//        along the journey that allow for the replacement of batteries; however, each service center provides batteries with a
//        specific capacity. You are given a 2D array in which servicecenter[i]=[xi,yj] indicates that the ith service center is
//        xi miles from the source city and offers yj miles after the automobile can travel after replacing batteries at specific
//        service centers. Return the number of times the car's batteries need to be replaced before arriving at the destination.
//        Input: serviceCenters = [{10,60},{20,30},{30,30},{60,40}], targetMiles= 100, startChargeCapacity = 10
//        Output: 2
//        Explanation: The car can go 10 miles on its initial capacity; after 10 miles, the car replaces batteries with a
//        capacity of 60 miles; and after travelling 50 miles, at position 60 we change batteries with a capacity of 40 miles;
//        and ultimately, we may arrive at our destination.
